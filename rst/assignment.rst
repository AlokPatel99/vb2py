General
-------

Assignment statements are translated to their equivalent Python versions. The main difference to VB is that un-assigned names which are not ``Dim``ed will cause a ``NameError`` in the Python code.


Default Conversion
------------------

VB::

    a = 10
	b = 20*30


List of Options
---------------

There are no options specific to the assignment statement.
